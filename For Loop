Lesson: Understanding the For Loop in Python

Objective:
- Learn how to use a for loop in Python
- Understand iteration and range function
- Write a simple script using a for loop

Concept:
A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, or a range of numbers).
It allows you to execute a block of code multiple times efficiently.

Example Syntax:
----------------------------------
for variable in sequence:
    # Code to execute
----------------------------------

Exercise:
Write a Python script that prints "Hello" 100 times using a for loop.

"""

# Python script that prints "Hello" 100 times
for i in range(100):
    print("Hello")
